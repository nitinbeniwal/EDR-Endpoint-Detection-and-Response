# EDR Endpoint Security System

## Introduction

The EDR Endpoint Security System is designed to monitor, detect, and respond to security threats on endpoints within an organization's network. This project includes an endpoint agent that collects system information and a centralized management console that displays the collected data and alerts on a web-based dashboard.


## Features
- Real-time monitoring of endpoint activities
- Advanced threat detection algorithms
- Automated response to detected threats
- Comprehensive reporting and analytics
- Integration with existing security infrastructure

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Ensure Node.js is installed to run the application.
- **MongoDB**: A MongoDB instance is required for data storage.
- **Git**: Git is needed to clone the repository.

## Components
### Endpoint Agent
### Centralized Management Console
#### `dashboard.html`
### Requirements
#### `requirements.txt`
### Setup and Running
#### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone <repository_url>
cd EDR-Endpoint-Security
```
#### 2. Set Up the Management Console

Navigate to the `management_console` directory and install the required packages:

```sh
cd management_console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3. Initialize the Database and Start the Flask Server

Run the Flask application:

```sh
python app.py
```

Ensure the server is running on `http://localhost:5000`.

#### 4. Run the Endpoint Agent

Open a new terminal window, navigate to the `endpoint_agent` directory, and run the agent script:

```sh
cd ../endpoint_agent
python agent.py
```

The agent will collect system information and send it to the Flask server every 60 seconds.

#### 5. Access the Dashboard

Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to view the dashboard displaying the endpoint data.

### Troubleshooting

- **Flask Server Issues:** Ensure the Flask server is running without errors. Check for any stack traces or error messages in the terminal where `app.py` is running.
- **Agent Connection Issues:** Ensure the agent is pointing to the correct URL and port of the Flask server. Verify there are no network issues.
- **Database Issues:** Ensure the `edr.db` file is in the correct location and the `endpoint_data` table exists.
